# Day 42 – Disaster Recovery Concepts

## Disaster Recovery
Disaster Recovery ensures systems can recover
from failures, outages, or data loss events.

---

## RTO
Recovery Time Objective defines
how quickly systems must be restored.

---

## RPO
Recovery Point Objective defines
how much data loss is acceptable.

---

## Recovery Strategies
Recovery models include backup-only,
pilot light, active-passive, and active-active.

---

## Multi-Region Design
Multi-region architectures protect
against regional failures but increase cost and complexity.

---

## Testing
Disaster recovery plans must be tested regularly
to ensure effectiveness.
