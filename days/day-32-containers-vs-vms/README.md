# Day 32 – Containers vs Virtual Machines

## Virtual Machines
Virtual Machines virtualize hardware and run a full operating system
for each instance, making them heavy but strongly isolated.

---

## Containers
Containers virtualize applications by sharing the host operating system kernel.
They are lightweight, fast, and efficient.

---

## Key Differences
Virtual Machines include a full OS per instance.
Containers share the host OS and package only the application and dependencies.

---

## Cloud Usage
Containers run on top of virtual machines in most cloud environments.
They improve deployment speed and resource utilization.

---

## Use Cases
VMs are suited for full OS control and legacy workloads.
Containers are ideal for scalable, cloud-native applications.
