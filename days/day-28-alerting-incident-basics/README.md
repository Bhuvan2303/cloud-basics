# Day 28 – Alerting and Incident Basics

## Alerting
Alerting notifies engineers when system metrics
cross critical thresholds requiring action.

---

## Good Alerts
Effective alerts are actionable, clear, and limited.
They help engineers respond quickly to real issues.

---

## Alert Fatigue
Too many alerts reduce effectiveness
and cause critical issues to be ignored.

---

## Incidents
An incident occurs when a system is degraded
or unavailable and impacts users.

---

## Incident Response
Incident response includes detection, mitigation,
communication, and postmortem analysis.

---

## Postmortems
Postmortems identify root causes and prevent
future incidents without assigning blame.
