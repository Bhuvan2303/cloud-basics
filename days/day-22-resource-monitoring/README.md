# Day 22 – Disk, Memory, and CPU Monitoring

## Resource Monitoring
Servers depend on disk, memory, and CPU to operate reliably.
Monitoring these resources prevents outages.

---

## Disk Monitoring
Disk usage is monitored using df and du.
A full disk can cause applications and services to fail.

---

## Memory Monitoring
Memory usage is checked using free.
If memory is exhausted, the system may kill running processes.

---

## CPU Monitoring
CPU usage is monitored using tools like top.
High CPU usage leads to slow performance and instability.

---

## Operational Importance
Understanding resource usage helps engineers detect
bottlenecks and scale systems proactively.
