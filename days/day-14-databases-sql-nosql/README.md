# Day 14 – SQL vs NoSQL Databases

## What is a Database
A database is used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.
Applications use databases to perform create, read, update, and delete operations.

---

## SQL Databases
SQL databases store data in structured tables with rows and columns.
They use a fixed schema and support relationships between tables.

Characteristics:
- Fixed schema
- Strong consistency
- Supports joins and transactions
- Uses ACID properties

Use cases:
- Banking systems
- Order management
- Financial applications

---

## NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases store data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, or columns.
They are designed for scalability and high performance.

Characteristics:
- Flexible schema
- Horizontal scaling
- High availability
- Often eventually consistent

Use cases:
- Logs and metrics
- User sessions
- Caching
- Real-time applications

---

## SQL vs NoSQL Comparison

SQL:
- Fixed schema
- Strong consistency
- Best for structured and relational data

NoSQL:
- Flexible schema
- Highly scalable
- Best for large-scale and changing data

---

## ACID Properties
ACID ensures reliable database transactions:
- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability

---

## Choosing the Right Database
SQL is used when data integrity and relationships are critical.
NoSQL is used when scalability and flexibility are more important.
