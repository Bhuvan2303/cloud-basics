# Day 25 – Redis Concepts

## Redis
Redis is an in-memory data store used for caching
and fast data access.

---

## Performance
Redis stores data in RAM, making it much faster
than disk-based databases.

---

## Architecture Role
Redis is placed between the application and the database
to reduce latency and database load.

---

## TTL
Redis supports Time To Live (TTL),
which automatically expires cached data.

---

## Use Cases
Redis is commonly used for sessions, caching,
rate limiting, and counters.
