# Day 31 – Secrets Management

## Secrets
Secrets are sensitive values such as passwords,
API keys, and tokens that grant access to systems.

## Risks of Hardcoding
Hardcoding secrets in code or repositories
can lead to leaks and security breaches.

Secrets can be managed using environment variables,
protected configuration files, or dedicated secret managers.

Secret managers store secrets securely,
control access using IAM, and support rotation.
