# Day 26 – CDN Concepts

## CDN
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed system
of edge servers that cache and deliver content closer to users.

---

## Request Flow
User requests are served from the nearest CDN edge location.
If content is not cached, it is fetched from the origin server.

---

## Performance Benefits
CDN reduces latency, improves load times,
and lowers load on origin servers.

---

## CDN vs Redis
CDN is used for global content delivery,
while Redis is used for application-level caching.

---

## Security Benefits
CDNs provide protection against large traffic spikes
and common internet attacks.
