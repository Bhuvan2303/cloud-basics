# Day 3 – Linux Command Line Basics

## Terminal
The terminal is a text-based interface used to interact with the operating system.
Cloud servers usually do not have a graphical interface, so engineers use the terminal.

## pwd
The pwd command shows the current working directory.
It tells where you are in the file system.

## ls
The ls command lists files and folders in a directory.
Common options:
- ls -l : detailed list
- ls -a : shows hidden files

## cd
The cd command is used to change directories.
Examples:
- cd folder_name
- cd ..
- cd /

## mkdir
The mkdir command creates a new directory.
Example:
mkdir test-folder

## rm
The rm command deletes files or directories.
Examples:
- rm file.txt
- rm -r folder_name

This command is powerful and dangerous if used incorrectly.
