# Day 40 – Terraform Architecture and Environment Design

## Modules
Terraform modules are reusable components
that organize and simplify infrastructure code.

---

## Environment Separation
Development and production environments
must be separated to prevent accidental impact.

---

## Variables
Modules use variables to customize infrastructure
for different environments.

---

## Remote State
Remote state enables safe collaboration
and prevents infrastructure conflicts.

---

## Best Practices
- Use modular design
- Separate environments
- Avoid large single-file configurations
