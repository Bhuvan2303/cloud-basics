# Day 16 – Linux Users and Groups

## Users
Linux supports multiple users to ensure security and accountability.
Each human should have a separate user account.

Root user has full control and should not be used for daily operations.

---

## Groups
Groups are used to manage permissions efficiently.
Permissions are assigned to groups, and users are added to groups.

This makes access control scalable and secure.

---

## User Management Commands
- useradd: create users
- groupadd: create groups
- usermod: modify user properties
- passwd: set or change password

---

## Best Practices
- One user per person
- Avoid shared accounts
- Use groups for permission management
