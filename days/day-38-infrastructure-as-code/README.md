# Day 38 – Infrastructure as Code

## Infrastructure as Code
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines cloud resources
using code instead of manual configuration.

---

## Benefits
IaC provides consistency, reproducibility,
automation, and version control for infrastructure.

---

## Declarative Model
Modern IaC tools use a declarative approach,
where the desired state is defined in code
and the tool ensures the infrastructure matches it.

---

## Importance
IaC reduces human error and enables scalable
and reliable cloud deployments.
