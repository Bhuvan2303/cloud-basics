## IAM
Identity and Access Management controls
who can access cloud resources and what actions they can perform.

## Identity
Identity represents a user, service, or application
requesting access to cloud resources.

---

## Authentication
Authentication verifies the identity using credentials
such as passwords, keys, or tokens.

---

## Authorization
Authorization determines what actions
an authenticated identity is allowed to perform.

---

## Roles and Policies
Roles provide temporary access without long-term credentials.
Policies define permissions and should follow least privilege.
