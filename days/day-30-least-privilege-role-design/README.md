# Day 30 – Least Privilege and Role Design

## Least Privilege
Least privilege means granting only the minimum permissions
required to perform a task.

This reduces security risks and limits blast radius.

---

## Role Design
Roles should be designed based on responsibility and usage.
Separate roles should exist for humans, applications, and automation.

---

## Over-Permission Risks
Excessive permissions increase the impact of credential compromise
and are a common cause of security incidents.

---

## Best Practices
- Use roles instead of long-term users
- Grant temporary access when possible
- Regularly review and reduce permissions
