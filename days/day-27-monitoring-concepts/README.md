# Day 27 – Monitoring Concepts

## Monitoring
Monitoring ensures systems are healthy and performant
by collecting signals and triggering alerts when needed.

---

## Metrics
Metrics are numeric values collected over time.
They are used to detect trends and trigger alerts.

Examples include CPU usage, memory usage, and latency.

---

## Logs
Logs are detailed records of events and errors.
They provide context and help diagnose problems.

---

## Alerts
Alerts are conditions set on metrics to notify engineers
when thresholds are crossed.

Alerts should be actionable and minimal.

---

## Observability Balance
Metrics show what is wrong.
Logs explain why it is wrong.
Effective systems use both.
