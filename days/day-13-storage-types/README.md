# Day 13 – Storage Types

## Block Storage
Block storage is like a hard disk attached to a server.
It is used for operating systems and databases because it is fast.

## Object Storage
Object storage is used to store files like images, videos, backups, and logs.
It is highly scalable and accessed using HTTP.

## File Storage
File storage is a shared file system that multiple servers can access.
It is used when many servers need the same files.

## Usage Summary
- Databases and OS use block storage
- Images, videos, and backups use object storage
- Shared application files use file storage
