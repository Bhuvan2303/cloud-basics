# Day 15 – Managed Databases and Backups

## Managed Databases
Managed databases are cloud-provided database services where the provider
handles maintenance, patching, backups, and high availability.

---

## Backups
Backups protect data from accidental deletion, corruption, and failures.
Automated backups and manual snapshots are both important.

---

## Point-in-Time Recovery
Point-in-time recovery allows restoring a database to a specific moment
before data loss occurred.

---

## High Availability
Managed databases use replicas in different availability zones.
If the primary database fails, a standby replica takes over automatically.

---

## Read Replicas
Read replicas are used to scale read-heavy workloads.
Write operations always go to the primary database.
