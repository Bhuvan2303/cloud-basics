# Day 35 – Kubernetes Introduction

## Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform
used to manage and scale containerized applications.

---

## Why Kubernetes
Docker runs containers, but Kubernetes manages them
across multiple machines at scale.

---

## Cluster Architecture
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a control plane
and worker nodes.

The control plane manages scheduling and desired state.
Worker nodes run the containers.

---

## Desired State
Kubernetes maintains the desired number of running containers.
If a container fails, it automatically replaces it.

---

## Cloud Importance
Kubernetes is widely used in modern cloud-native architectures.
